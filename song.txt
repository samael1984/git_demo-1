Guilty until proven innocent
We condemn your soul and fate
Guilty until proven innocent
We condemn your soul and fate

Take part in a diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is acknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished

Without judgement, what would we do?
We would be forced to look
At ourselves emerged in lost time assuming what may be
Without judgement perception would increase a million times
